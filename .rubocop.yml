# Parser spec requires detailed verification of AST structures, which inherently
# leads to longer test cases. Each test needs to verify multiple aspects of the
# parsed nodes (type, value, children) to ensure correct parsing behavior.
# Breaking these into smaller examples would reduce the readability and make
# the test intentions less clear.
#
# Pretty printing tests need to verify multiple aspects of the output:
# node types, values, indentation, and overall structure. These verifications
# are strongly related and share setup context. Splitting them would obscure
# the relationship between different aspects of the pretty printed output.
